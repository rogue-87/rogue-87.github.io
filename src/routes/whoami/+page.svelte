		ah! so you're actually interested in reading a random guy's web page that you know nothing
		about? cool!
	</p>

	<br />

	<p>
		My name is Ali. I'm a {new Date().getFullYear() - 2003} years old guy who happens to know a thing
		or two about computers. My first programming language was Java, though I didn't do much with it,
		mainly because that was what my university offered. Later on, I learned JavaScript, and then Lua(because
		neovim, of course). I kinda lost track of where I was when I fell into the Linux rabbit hole, but
		now I'm back on track and resuming my journey into the unknown.
	</p>

	<br />

	<p>
		I first started learning about web development, and I initially wanted to be a web developer.
		after a while... that dream sorta died really quickly, and I started fiddling around with random
		stuff again. I found interest in operating systems and also how programming languages work. I
		feel like it's gonna be a long trip but also it seems fun!

	<h2>What do you do?</h2>
	<hr />

	<br />

	<p>
		currently I'm an IT student at <a href="https://uob.edu.ly/">University of Benghazi</a>.
		Studying computer science. doing good so far, and hopefully I'll graduate by the end of 2025(or
		probably the beginning of 2026)!

				well not really, I used to have interest in pixel art, and it died the moment I got into
				University. Here's some cool biker art!
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>I made it using aseprite!</p>

			<br />
			<p>
				even tho I like aseprite, I've been transitioning to pixelorama. why leave aseprite for
				pixelorama? you may ask. Well, because I don't want to compile aseprite from source :p
